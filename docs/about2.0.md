# About Render Dragon Shader List 2.0  

Render Dragon Shader List 2.0 focuses on boldly removing unnecessary content and adding essential information for users, ensuring the continued maintenance and improvement of the RD Shader List.  

One of the most noticeable changes from version 1.0, and likely the most inconvenient for many users, is the removal of the version hyperlink feature that allowed direct downloads from the list.  
This feature had been available since the early days of the Render Dragon Shader List and was highly convenient. However, constantly monitoring version updates and manually modifying the document to reflect new versions of specific shaders was a time-consuming task.  
To ensure the list's maintainability, it was decided to remove this feature.  

Additionally, many other elements of the RD Shader List have been updated, such as changing the font used in banner images to Noto Sans.  
As mentioned earlier, these changes aim to enable ongoing maintenance and create a more intuitive structure.

## Things to Add in Version 2.0  

**More Screenshots and Backlinks in the Screenshot Documents**  
Adding more screenshots increases traffic, which, in turn, improves exposure on Google Images. This can help reduce the search visibility of shader pack illegal redistribution sites.  
We need to add more screenshots for each shader and provide hyperlinks in the screenshot documents for easy navigation back to the corresponding shader.  

**Guides Tailored to the New Mod**  
During the downtime of the Render Dragon Shader List, many innovations occurred.  
As a result, there is a need to create updated guides to reflect these changes.  

**More Facts About Render Dragon Shaders**  
A document is needed to organize various facts that general players may not know, such as why deferred packs differ from shaders, along with correcting misinformation and explaining terms related to shaders.
