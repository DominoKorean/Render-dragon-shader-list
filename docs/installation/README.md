## Mobile

### Android

> Most phones except for Apple devices—such as Samsung Galaxy, Xiaomi, and Google Pixel—use Android.

1. Install [MB Loader](https://github.com/DominoKorean/Render-dragon-shader-list/blob/main/language/ko_kr/README.md#mb-loader).
2. Press the `Load to mbl2` button to launch the currently installed version of Minecraft.
3. Download a shader pack from the Renderdragon Shader List and load it as a resource pack, then apply it under **Global Resources**.

If you prefer the older method using patched apps, try using [Draco Injector](https://github.com/mcbegamerxx954/draco-injector).

If you want to manually modify the APK and apply shaders, refer to the following document:
* [Manual Installation Guide](android.md)

<br>

### iOS

> For iPhone and iPad, please refer to this document.

* [RenderDragon Shader Installation on iOS](iOS.md)

<br>

## PC

### Windows

1. Download the latest version from the Releases section of [BetterRenderDragon](https://github.com/dreamguxiang/BetterRenderDragon-xmake).
2. Extract the contents of `BetterRenderDragon.zip` and run the `bat` file.
   - For release versions, run `LaunchMinecraft.bat`.
   - For beta/preview versions, run `LaunchMinecraftPreview.bat`.
3. Download a shader pack from the Renderdragon Shader List and load it as a resource pack, then apply it under **Global Resources**.

If you cannot use **BetterRenderDragon**, you may use [**Matject**](https://github.com/faizul726/matject) instead.

## Troubleshooting

> - **Only the water or sky in the shader pack is applied, or those effects are missing.**  
> Restarting Minecraft usually solves the problem.

> - **Shaders do not work when I join a server.**  
> Shaders may not function properly on servers due to server resource packs.

> - **Shaders don’t work when I apply them to a map.**  
> Please make sure to apply them via Global Resources.

> [!NOTE]  
> For issues or bugs not listed above, please contact the shader developer.
